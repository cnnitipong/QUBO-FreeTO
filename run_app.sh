#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Launch the QFF-3D web app (Quantum Free-Form 3D Topology Optimisation,
# built on FreeTO; Python package `freeto`) on Linux.
#
#  - Finds a real Python 3.10-3.13 interpreter, preferring one of those exact
#    versions on PATH over whatever generic "python3" resolves to (which
#    could be 3.14+, and the optional "pyamg" fast solver has no wheels for
#    that yet -- see requirements.txt).
#  - Creates the virtual environment OUTSIDE this project folder, at
#    ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/FreeTO-Python/venv (override with the
#    FREETO_VENV environment variable; the folder name is kept from
#    FreeTO-Python so an existing install is reused) -- this folder itself may live in a
#    long, spaced, cloud-synced path, which is a bad place for a venv.
#  - Installs requirements.txt only when it is new or has changed since the
#    last successful install (compared byte-for-byte with `cmp` against a
#    saved copy next to the venv), so repeat launches work fully offline.
#  - Always calls the venv's own python directly ("$VPY" -m ...) instead of
#    `source .venv/bin/activate` + a bare `python`/`pip`.
#  - Does not use `set -e`: every step is checked explicitly, and this script
#    exits with a clear message on failure rather than an opaque stack trace
#    (there is no "press Enter to close" pause here, unlike the macOS/Windows
#    double-click launchers -- run_app.sh is normally started from a terminal
#    that was already open, so it never needs to be kept from vanishing).
