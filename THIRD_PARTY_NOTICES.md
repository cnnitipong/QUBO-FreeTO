QFF-3D (the `freeto` package, FreeTO-Python, and its web app) is a Python port and extension of other people's work. Their licences are kept here as they require.

## FreeTO (MATLAB) - MIT License

The numerical core (mesh generation, SIMP/SEMDOT, filters, smooth-edge projection, STL output) and the example
STL files in `examples/STLs/` (not `examples/STLs/generated/`, which `examples/make_examples.py` creates) are ported from
or taken from FreeTO, https://github.com/ooibhadode/FreeTO
